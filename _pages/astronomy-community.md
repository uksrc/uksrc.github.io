UK-based astronomers will have opportunities to inform the UKSRCâ€™s technical development and to enhance their skills in preparation for the deployment of the SKA telescopes:
* UKSRC Demonstrator Cases: provides structured support enabling astronomy communities to develop skills in articulating their requirements and testing the proto-UKSRC facility 
* UKSRC Champion Scheme: support for community-led initiatives that will enable research communities to develop the skills, knowledge and mindset needed to harness SKA data
* UKSRC Training: developing UKSRC specific resources and training in collaboration with the wider SRCnet and established astronomy summer schools.
* UKSRC prototype computational facilities and support: Alongside other SRC nodes, the UKSRC enables research groups to participate in the SKAO Science Data Challenges. The SKAO disseminates synthetic datasets that emulate the telescope's capabilities to test the suitability of existing methods and foster the development of new ones on these next-generation, scientific datasets.

## UKRI UK SKA Observatory Science Committee (UKSKAOSC) ##
The UKSKAOSC acts as the conduit between the UK-SKA programme and the UK science community, communicating the latest news and project time points, encouraging involvement, and helping to achieve the UK science priorities and objectives from the SKA.
