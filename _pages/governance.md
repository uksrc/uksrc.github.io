## SKA Regional Centre Steering Committee (SRCSC) ##
The mission of the SRCSC is to define and create a long-term operational partnership between the SKA Observatory and an ensemble of independently-resourced SKA Regional Centres. The SRCSC has participants taken from across the SKA membership, selected by each country to represent their national interests. The SRCSC will be superseded in due course by the operational partnership that is formed as a result of its work.
