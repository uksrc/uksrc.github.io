The [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/) is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together nations from around the world. Its mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe, and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation. The observatory has a global footprint and consists of the SKAO Global Headquarters in the UK, the SKAO’s [two telescopes (SKA-Low and SKA-Mid)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes) at radio-quiet sites in South Africa and Australia, and associated facilities to support the operations of the telescopes.  
The two telescopes will operate from 50 MHz to 350 MHz (SKA-LOW) and 350 MHz to 15.4 GHz (SKA-MID) respectively. Both telescopes will provide order of magnitude increases in survey speed compared to existing instruments and so will test existing, and develop new, theories over a very broad range of science areas. These include General Relativity, Cosmology, the Cosmic Dawn, Galaxy Formation and Evolution, the Cradle of Life, Cosmic Magnetism and the Exploration of the Unknown.  
Both SKA telescopes will transfer an average of 8 terabits per second of data to their [Science Data Processors (SDP)](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data) which are based in South Africa and Australia respectively. These SDP supercomputers will calibrate and process the telescope timestream data to produce Observatory Level Data Products (OLDPs). A wide variety of different OLDPs can be produced depending upon the specific science goal. The OLDPs will distributed via intercontinental telecommunications networks to the SKA Regional Centres (SRC) for further processing to generate Advanced Data Products (ADP), which will then be used by scientists to produce scientific results.

## SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) ## 
[Member states](https://www.skao.int/en/partners/skao-members) are developing an internationally interoperable network of [SKA Regional Centres](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/big-data/362/ska-regional-centres), which will be the only route for researchers to access SKA data products and perform advanced scientific analysis. Six components have been identified for the SRCNet’s community and SKA Observatory facing functionalities: Data Logistics, Commonality, Data Processing, Data Archiving and Curation, Scalable Resource Management and Allocation, and User Support. These facilities and services will enable researchers to harness SKA data and revolutionise our understanding of the Universe.
