# Current Vacancies
The UK SKA Regional Centre (UKSRC) is a major development project which is contributing to the development of the global SRC Network. The UKSRC, as part of the SRCNet, will deliver the storage and archive, data analysis and processing capabilities, as well as user support and management services needed for researchers to harness the Square Kilometre Array Observatory  (see https://www.uksrc.org).

The UKSRC Project Board seeks a new co-Chair with expertise in **Digital Research Infrastructure** , to join David Bacon (University of Portsmouth) and Chiara Ferrari (SKA-FRANCE Director) in leading the board.
 

The UKSRC Project Board’s (PB) purpose is to:
- provide external guidance and advice on scientific, technical and management matters related to the UKSRC project;
- monitor the delivery of the UKSRC project;
- provide advice regarding the UKSRC’s future development;
- consider and approve amendments to the UKSRC Project Plan and future requests for funding applications to UKRI and other funding bodies; and
- to ensure that the activities of the project reflect the UK research community’s interests; and
- act as a ‘critical friend’ to the collaboration, providing support and challenge.

Membership would begin in December 2024 appointed for two years in the first instance. This is not a salaried position.

Selection criteria  
We require a candidate with a deep understanding of the Digital Research Infrastructure landscape, and a track record of engagement in this domain.  

Please provide a statement of no more than three paragraphs outlining why you would be appropriate for the Project Board including your experience in this field and Committee/Panel background.  
A dynamic, diverse and inclusive Board is critical to ensuring the UKSRC project receives the best strategic advice and we encourage applications from all diverse backgrounds, demonstrating the appropriate skills, expertise and experience required.    
Nominations should be sent to George Madden (george.madden@stfc.ukri.org) or Simon Haynes (simon.haynes@stfc.ukri.org) by the closing date of 15th November 2024.
