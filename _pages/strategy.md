The [UK SKA Regional Centre Strategy](https://policycommons.net/artifacts/3174561/uk-ska-regional-centre-strategy-1/3973055) covers the timescale of the construction phase and early operations phase (up to 2030) and provides the strategy for UK involvement in the SRCNet. The UKSRC Development Project (2023-2025) will contribute to the delivery of this strategy.
## Vision ##
* To enable UK scientists to lead exploitation of SKA data, by meeting the needs of the UK Science Community and providing seamless access to SKA data and support.
## Mission ##
* To maximise the return to the UK through a contribution to the SRCNet at a level commensurate with the UK's leading role in the project.
* To deliver a UKSRC Node, enabling the UK to maximise scientific return and drive innovation in data science. 
## Strategic Pillars ##
* SRC Network: To lead, participate and influence global SKA Regional Centre activities for the benefit of the UK.
* UK SKA Regional Centre: To design, deliver and support an SRC within the UK, which will form a component of the global SRC Network.
* UK Science Community: To communicate and engage with the UK Science Community, ensuring the SRC Network and UKSRC meet the needs of the community.
