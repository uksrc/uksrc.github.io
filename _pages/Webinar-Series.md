# UKSRC Webinar Series 
### Thursday 3 October 2024 11:30 -12:30 BST (12:30 CEST / 11:30 UK time) 

* #### The next generation of milliarcsecond surveys with SKA-VLBI (Dr Jack Radcliffe, U. Pretoria & U. Manchester)
    This UKSRC webinar is in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA). THe registration link is coming soon....
  
  Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), using both SKA-Low and Mid, is poised to deliver groundbreaking observations with milliarcsecond resolution, surpassing the capabilities of the standard SKA array. In conjunction with the SKA, VLBI holds the promise of unlocking profound insights across various astrophysical topics and science working groups. VLBI with the SKA stands to revolutionise our understanding of galaxy evolution and the physics of jet accretion by studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at low luminosities. Moreover, it is poised to make significant contributions to cosmology by constraining dark energy and dark matter via gravitational lenses and studying nuclear water masers. Exploring the stellar lifecycle, including the temporal evolution of supernova remnants and the rapid follow-up of transients (e.g., localising FRBs and tidal disruption events) adds another dimension to the diverse range of science that VLBI can investigate with the SKA. SKA-VLBI is set to offer unparalleled astrometric observations capable of measuring proper motions and parallaxes of galactic objects. This capability opens the door to mapping the structure of our Galaxy and testing gravity within binary systems. This overview highlights just a subset of the topics addressed in this presentation. I will delve into the scientific achievements achievable through VLBI with the SKA and elucidate the operational aspects of SKA-VLBI

### Thursday 25 July 2024, 12:00-12:50 UTC+1
Please [register](https://ucl.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_vIEHTvaWTLyMgl25njSgaA#/registration) to join us at our next UKSRC Webnar Series scheduled on July 25th at 12:00 UTC+1 with the folowing talks: 

* #### Developing a science-analysis platform for the SKA (Dr Chris Skipper)
  The SKA is set to bring about a paradigm shift in our approach to astronomical-data analysis, with unprecedented volumes of data making it impractical for astronomers to download and reduce data on their own desktop computers or laptops. The science community will instead interact with SKA datasets through an online science-analysis platform, providing data access and a rich set of tools for data analysis, whilst the data remains stored within a network of high-performance computing centres. It is absolutely essential that SKA data is made accessible to as wide an audience as possible, without the need for users to be computing experts or 'radio-astronomy ninjas'. In this talk I will outline the SRCNet vision for this science-analysis platform, and demonstrate some features of the prototype that has been developed for the first release early next year.
  
* #### Towards a systematic sub-arcsecond resolution survey of the Northern low-frequency sky (Dr Frits Sweijen)
  Over the past years high-resolution processing of International LOFAR Telescope data has made great strides. With the pipeline coming together, routine data processing for select targets is becoming feasible. One thing this now enables is to do is high-resolution post-processing of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). This "LoTSS-HR" project will target the LoTSS sources above 10 mJy for postage stamp imaging, with the ultimate aim of a sub-arcsecond resolution survey of the northern sky. To illustrate the science this will facilitate I will highlight some recent work happening within the LOFAR group at Durham.
