This is the Markdown/Jekyll source for the UK SKA Regional Centre project.

See [Minimal Mistakes guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) for documentation on how to use this Jekyll theme, and intro to [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) for the syntax used.

In general, add a new page under pages/ and then add it to one of the navigation to add it to the menu and/or link to it from existing pages.
