SKA Science Data Challenge 2: analysis and results

Over 100 participants  to find and characterise 233245 neutral hydrogen (Hi) sources in a simulated data product representing a 2000 h SKA MID spectral
line observation from redshifts 0.25 to 0.5. 

IRIS and seven other international supercomputing facilties provided dedicated computational resources

‘reproducibility awards’ were made in
recognition of those pipelines which demonstrated Open Science best practice. The Challenge
saw over 100 participants develop a range of new and existing techniques, with results that
highlight the strengths of multidisciplinary and collaborative effort. The winning strategy –
which combined predictions from two independent machine learning techniques to yield a
20 percent improvement in overall performance – underscores one of the main Challenge
outcomes: that of method complementarity. It is likely that the combination of methods in a
so-called ensemble approach will be key to exploiting very large astronomical datasets.
