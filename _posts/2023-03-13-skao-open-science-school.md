**Are you interested in Open Science and the effect it will have on your research and tools?**
Join Dr Rachael Ainsworth and the other tutors at the first SKAO Open Science School (8th-10th May 2023) to learn:
- What is Open Science and how can we expect it to change and benefit science and society?
- How will the SKAO and the SKA Regional Centres enable best practices in Open Science?
- As a senior researcher/PhD student/engineer, how do Open Science practices and policies benefit and change my research/collaborations/services and tools?
- What tools can I use to follow Open Science principles?
- Will Open Science be acknowledged in the research assessment system? How can I capture Open Science merits in my CV?

By making data and methods more accessible, understandable and reusable, Open Science practices facilitate reproducibility of scientific studies. In alignment with several United Nations sustainable development goals, the concept of Open Science contributes to democratising information and reducing inequalities in accessing scientific infrastructures. Open Science is rooted in the SKAOâ€™s foundational principles and the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) will play a key role in providing the framework for implementing SKA Open Science policies. 

This school brings an opportunity to anyone from the astronomy and SRCNet communities to gain a detailed view of Open Science policies and tools, as well as ongoing activities related to Open Science at the SKAO and the SRCNet.

The school is organised by the IAA-CSIC and SKAO and it is endorsed by the SKA Regional Centre partner training programme.
