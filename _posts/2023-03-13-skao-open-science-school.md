Open to the global astronomy community, this school provides a detailed view of Open Science policies and tools, as well as ongoing SKA activities. The SKA Regional Center Network (SRCNet) will play a key role enabling big scientific collaborations and it will provide the framework to implement SKA Open Science policies. 
Join Dr Rachael Ainsworth and the other tutors at the [1st SKAO Open Science School](https://www.granadacongresos.com/skaopenscience) (8th-10th May 2023 in Granada or online) to learn:
- What is Open Science and how can we expect it to change and benefit science and society?
- How will the SKAO and the SKA Regional Centres enable best practices in Open Science?
- As a senior researcher/PhD student/engineer, how do Open Science practices and policies benefit and change my research/collaborations/services and tools?
- What tools can I use to follow Open Science principles?
- Will Open Science be acknowledged in the research assessment system? How can I capture Open Science merits in my CV?
- By making data and methods more accessible, understandable and reusable, Open Science practices facilitate reproducibility of scientific studies.
