Modern radio astronomy/cosmology, powered by advances in big data analysis, is at the forefront of studies to unlock the answers to some of the most fundamental physics questions in our time. We are looking for a talented early career scientist to promote and develop ambitious programmes aimed at investigating the universe via radio observations. The successful candidate will be expected to lead the development of advanced data analysis for radio astronomy/cosmology (e.g. statistical analysis, machine learning, etc), in collaboration with observational/experimental activities in Cambridge. In particular, the global astrophysics community is eagerly awaiting the start of scientific observations of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (www.skao.int), commonly known as SKA, the largest and most powerful radio telescope ever to exist, currently under construction. The role holder will have the opportunity to take a leading role in our existing SKA activities and grants (eg SKA development grants). Furthermore, we expect the successful candidate to be well-placed to lead development efforts for SKA Phase II, expected to start within the coming years.
