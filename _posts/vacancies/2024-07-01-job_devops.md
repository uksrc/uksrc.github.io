The successful candidate will become part of a diverse and dynamic team of astronomers, computer scientists and engineers using Scaled Agile techniques to develop the advanced solutions necessary for a new era in radio astronomy. The UKSRC activities span 7 UK institutes and in the Cavendish we are contributing to the UK work package focussed on the astronomy pipelines, distributed processing approaches and science platforms. To enable and support this team, and wider activities, we are seeking a computing engineer to assist in areas such as helpdesk ticketing and documentation, application installation, configuration & troubleshooting, systems administration and general operations. An ideal candidate will have some knowledge of container orchestration and release engineering and be able to assist with aspects of research software engineering. Training opportunities to develop and sharpen skills will be available. Cambridge is a provider of High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for UKSRC and has a large team developing novel federated cloud platform technologies as well as providing leadership on system architecture. Our engineering post holder will therefore have an opportunity to work alongside HPC and cloud platform experts locally, as well as gain experience working in a large international project as part of the global SRC activities brought together in the SRC Network.
