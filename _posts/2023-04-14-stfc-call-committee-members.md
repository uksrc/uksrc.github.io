## UK Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) Science Committee ##

The UK Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) Science Committee is looking for new members to serve from the 1 June 2023 for two years, with an option to extend for an additional year. There are six vacancies available this year. These meetings offer a chance for members to hear the latest updates regarding progress on the project and to feed this news back to their respective communities. This is also an opportunity for members to provide input into how STFC and the SKAO might facilitate closer engagement with the UK scientific community and better share information regarding SKAO science to the public.
The committee also works closely with an early career research (ECR) sub-committee which has representation at all meetings. Membership to the ECR sub-committee is not requested in this call.

The positions on the committee are ideally suited for researchers at any stage of their career in the radio astronomy or related fields (including high-performance computing (HPC) and software development) with links to the UK scientific community. (there is a separate call for early career researchers (PhDs and postdocs) to join the ECR sub-committee). However, facilities users, applicants from academia, research institutes, those from cross disciplines, and national laboratories are welcome to apply.

The deadline to apply for either committee is the 14th May 2023
