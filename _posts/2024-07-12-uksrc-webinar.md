The next [UKSRC webinar](https://www.uksrc.org/webinar-series/) will be held on Thursday 25 July 2024, 12:00-12:50 UTC. [Please register](https://ucl.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_vIEHTvaWTLyMgl25njSgaA#/registration) to join us for the folowing talks:

**Developing a science-analysis platform for the SKA** (Dr Chris Skipper, University of Manchester)
The SKA is set to bring about a paradigm shift in our approach to astronomical-data analysis, with unprecedented volumes of data making it impractical for astronomers to download and reduce data on their own desktop computers or laptops. The science community will instead interact with SKA datasets through an online science-analysis platform, providing data access and a rich set of tools for data analysis, whilst the data remains stored within a network of high-performance computing centres. It is absolutely essential that SKA data is made accessible to as wide an audience as possible, without the need for users to be computing experts or 'radio-astronomy ninjas'. In this talk I will outline the SRCNet vision for this science-analysis platform, and demonstrate some features of the prototype that has been developed for the first release early next year.

**Towards a systematic sub-arcsecond resolution survey of the Northern low-frequency sky** (Dr Frits Sweijen, Durham University)
Over the past years high-resolution processing of International LOFAR Telescope data has made great strides. With the pipeline coming together, routine data processing for select targets is becoming feasible. One thing this now enables is to do is high-resolution post-processing of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). This "LoTSS-HR" project will target the LoTSS sources above 10 mJy for postage stamp imaging, with the ultimate aim of a sub-arcsecond resolution survey of the northern sky. To illustrate the science this will facilitate I will highlight some recent work happening within the LOFAR group at Durham.
