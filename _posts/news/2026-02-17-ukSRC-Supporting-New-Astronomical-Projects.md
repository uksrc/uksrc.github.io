The ukSRC facility is now supporting nine new science cases as part of our expanded Demonstrator Case scheme.

This scheme is designed to support UK astronomy using SKAO precursors and pathfinders while allowing the ukSRC to develop its facility to continuing to support the next generation of discoveries in radio astronomy. The cases represent a subset of the UK SKAO community to support evolving science and new technical innovations, preparing a ukSRC fit for the coming decades of SKA science.  

The Demonstrator Cases span a range of scientific objectives and technical requirements, aiming to achieve the following objectives: 

1. To grow UK leadership in SKA science areas and build on existing leadership in SKA pathfinder and precursor facilities. 
2. To engage with the UK astronomy community to review and refresh the demonstrator topics to accurately reflect research ambitions as they evolve over the project duration. 
3. To develop researchers’ skills, knowledge, and experience to enable full exploitation of SKA and its precursor data. 
4. To inform the development of the UKSRC facility and the wider SRCNet.

Below we highlight some of the supported cases, including the Principal Investigator, host institution, and title of their demonstrator cases.
