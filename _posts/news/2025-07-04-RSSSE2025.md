**UKSRC team members made up part of the army of volunteers from across the UK at the year's [Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/summer-science-exhibition/).**

Lara Alegre (Research Scientist, University of Hertfordshire) and Andrew Gordon (Programme Manager, University of Manchester) joined colleagues from [SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en) and [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) at this year’s Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London, volunteering as part of the team running the SKAO exhibit.

The exhibition welcomed thousands of visitors over the week, offering a chance to explore the science behind the Square Kilometre Array and the UK’s involvement in the project. As part of the team of volunteers, Lara and Andrew spoke with school groups, families, and members of the public about how radio telescopes work, what the SKA will study, and how it fits into the wider field of astronomy.

**The future science of the SKA was front and centre as part of the exhibit.**

The SKAO exhibit featured hands-on activities, radio wave detection experiments, and a display of components from both the SKA-Mid dishes and SKA-Low antennas. These helped visitors understand how the SKA will detect faint cosmic signals and what kind of discoveries it might enable. Hundreds of people stopped by the stand, engaging with the science and asking questions about everything from black holes to data processing.

Lara and Andrew also talked about the role of UKSRC in supporting researchers who will work with SKA data, and how projects like this are changing the way science is done — especially in terms of collaboration, computing, and careers in astronomy.
