John Garbutt (StackHPC) will be presenting some of our latest developments on how we are making HPC more user accessible at Computing Insight UK (CIUK, 7-8 December 2023).

CIUK combines an exhibition of the latest High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware and software with a programme of presentations from users who provide an overview of their use of HPC in real life situations.  The theme for this year's conference is "Productive Supercomputing (Accessible and diverse large scale computing)" with sub-themes including "User Support", "Industry Use of HPC", “Making HPC More Accessible”, “User Portals”, “Convergence of AI and Simulation” and "Co-Design of Supercomputing Services and Systems".
