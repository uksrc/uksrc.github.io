Astronomers from all over the world are competing in the [3rd SKA Science Data Challenge (SDC3)](https://sdc3.skao.int/overview) which provides the research community an opportunity to evaluate existing methods and to develop new approaches to analysis in peparation for data from the SKA telescopes. The UK-based STFC-IRIS high performance computing resources are part of the international support available for the teams participating in the challenge. SCD3 is focused on determining exactly when (using an an artificial dataset) the Epoch of Reionisation occurred and is in two parts:

- Removal of foreground emission from Galactic and Extragalactic sources ('Foregrounds', or SDC3a)
- Inference of important parameters of the Epoch of Reionisation ('Inference', or SDC3b) 

 We are looking forward to seeing the results from the four UK teams that are participating in SDC3a!
