SKAO Science Data Challenge 3 

Three UK teams kicked off theiir regrounds' challenge asks participants to remove obscuring sources of emission which prevent analysis of the underlying hydrogen-21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionisation. This foreground emission stems from both Galactic and extragalactic sources, both of which have previously observed, and unobserved components. Given the lack of a model for the finer structure of Galactic emission at SKA-LOW frequencies, the removal of Galactic emission from the dataset represents a significant challenge. By similar reasoning, source confusion from previously unknown extragalactic sources, especially at the coarser resolution at metre-wavelengths, complicates the matter further. From our synthetic datasets, participants are asked to extract the cylindrically-averaged power spectrum of the EoR signal, clean from foregrounds contamination.
