UK-based STFC-IRIS high performance computing resources are part of the international support available for astronomers competing in the [3rd SKA Science Data Challenge (SDC3)](https://sdc3.skao.int/overview). The research community will evaluate existing methods and to develop new approaches for data analysis in preparation for the SKA telescope deployment. SCD3 is focused on determining when the Epoch of Reionisation occurred and there are two independent parts:

- Removal of foreground emission from Galactic and Extragalactic sources ('Foregrounds', or SDC3a)
- Inference of important parameters of the Epoch of Reionisation ('Inference', or SDC3b)  

SDC3a started on 1st March 2023 and we wish the four UK-based groups and participants around the world the best of luck!
