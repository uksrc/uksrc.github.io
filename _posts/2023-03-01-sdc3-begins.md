UK-based STFC-IRIS high performance computing resources are part of the international support available for astronomers competing in the [3rd SKA Science Data Challenge (SDC3)](https://sdc3.skao.int/challenges/foregrounds/teams) which is focused on when the Epoch of Reionisation occurred. During the challenge, the research community will evaluate existing methods and to develop new approaches for data analysis in preparation for the SKA telescope deployment. SCD3 is consists of two independent parts:

- Removal of foreground emission from Galactic and Extragalactic sources ('Foregrounds', or SDC3a)
- Inference of important parameters of the Epoch of Reionisation ('Inference', or SDC3b)  

Four UK-based groups are currently taking part SDC3a and we wish all of the teams the best of luck with the challenge!
