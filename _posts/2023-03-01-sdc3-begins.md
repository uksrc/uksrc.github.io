Astronomers from all over the world are competing in the third SKA Science Data Challenge (SDC3) which aims to X U Z. 

SKA Science Data Challenges help the astronomy community to evaluate existing methods and to develop new approaches to analysis in peparation for data from the SKA telescopes. 

The challenge is focused on determining exactly when (using an an artificial dataset) the Epoch of Reionisation occurred. 

- Removal of foreground emission from Galactic and Extragalactic sources ('Foregrounds', or SDC3a)
- Inference of important parameters of the Epoch of Reionisation ('Inference', or SDC3b)

Four UK teams are participating


Three UK teams kicked off theiir regrounds' challenge asks participants to remove obscuring sources of emission which prevent analysis of the underlying hydrogen-21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionisation. This foreground emission stems from both Galactic and extragalactic sources, both of which have previously observed, and unobserved components. Given the lack of a model for the finer structure of Galactic emission at SKA-LOW frequencies, the removal of Galactic emission from the dataset represents a significant challenge. By similar reasoning, source confusion from previously unknown extragalactic sources, especially at the coarser resolution at metre-wavelengths, complicates the matter further. From our synthetic datasets, participants are asked to extract the cylindrically-averaged power spectrum of the EoR signal, clean from foregrounds contamination.

UKSRC is supporting the SDC3 by providing computational resources and support to
