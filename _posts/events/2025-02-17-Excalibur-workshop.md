This [event](https://excalibur.ac.uk/events/image-reconstruction-at-scale-challenges-and-collaboration/) brings together experts from astronomy, microscopy, and related fields to explore advances in large-scale image reconstruction. The primary goal is to foster collaboration within the [ExCALIBUR](https://excalibur.ac.uk) network and the wider scientific community.

Key discussions will focus on designing solutions for large-scale image data reconstruction, tackling computational complexity and model uncertainty, and harnessing high-performance computing (HPC) to drive innovation.

Supported by the ExCALIBUR H&ES programme, this meeting aims to uncover new approaches and partnerships in large-scale image analysis.
