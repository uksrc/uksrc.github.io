This UK SKA Regional Centre project is funded by DSIT. It is one of four pilot initiatives which aim to address barriers to data sharing (the Research Data Cloud Pilot project â€“ RDCP). The overall objective is to test and understand the need for a national research cloud through a series of interventions designed to remove data sharing barriers, in order to identify potential models and options for future national scale initiatives, and to build an investment case and set out the role of Government.
