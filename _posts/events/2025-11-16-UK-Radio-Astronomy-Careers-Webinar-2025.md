The UK SKAO Early Career Researchers (ECR) committee is hosting a careers panel. Our panel includes speakers from academia, industry and SKAO -

- **Naomi McClure-Griffiths** - SKAO Chief Scientist
- **Dave DeBoer** - Breakthrough Listen and University of Oxford
- **Bella Boulderstone** - Senior Applied Data Scientist at dunnhumby
- **Jack Hickish** - Founder, Real-Time Radio Systems
- **Anna Scaife** - University of Manchester and The Alan Turing Institute

The panellists will discuss their careers, career related topics and take part in a question and answer session. While the event is aimed at the radio astronomy community, we also encourage early career researchers from other fields in astronomy and astrophysics to attend, as the discussion will also cover many general aspects of careers for astrophysics ECRs.

If you are interested in submitting any topics for discussion or questions for the panellists in advance of the session, [please complete this form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/PpDJP3KYQG). There will also be the opportunity to ask your questions on the day.
