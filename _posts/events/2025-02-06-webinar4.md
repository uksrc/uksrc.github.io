webinarabstract: Data-intensive research, open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility, represent a new mode of science, with its own work practices, methods and epistemologies (Leonelli, 2014). This form of doing science is not only transforming many professional domains but also the way researchers relate to themselves, others and knowledge. Various policy reports and research indicate that open science and data sharing are essential for advancing scientific inquiry and knowledge, fostering new forms of collaboration, communication, and reflection. However, these advancements introduce challenges that extend beyond technical aspects, touching on social and cultural dimensions as well.

Despite ongoing efforts to promote data sharing within and across research communities, there is still limited understanding of the complex and emerging forms of epistemic uncertainties and resistance associated with adopting data sharing, especially when science is being transformed by the emergence and adoption of new types of Digital Research Infrastructures (DRIs).
Based on insights from the [FAIR Data Pilot Project: Cultivating Cultures of Data Sharing](https://www.uksrc.org/fair-data-pilot/), this presentation will examine the social and cultural barriers to data sharing and propose strategies to cultivate Cultures of Data Sharing across scientific communities.
