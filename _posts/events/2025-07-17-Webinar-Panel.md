This session will provide updates following the recent [SKAO science meeting](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/skao-science-meeting-2025), including details on Science Verification timelines, data products ([see SKAO science user webpages](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users)), and community engagement opportunities. There will also be time for Q&A.
