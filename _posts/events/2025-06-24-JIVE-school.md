The JIVE VLBI School (JVS 2025) is an exciting opportunity for professionals and students interested in the field of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
 
The JVS 2025 is designed to provide comprehensive training in data processing and imaging techniques specific to VLBI observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN). Participants will benefit from:

- **General Lectures** covering fundamental concepts in radio interferometry and delving into the specifics of VLBI.
- **Interactive Learning**: Attend common lectures streamed live from both venues and participate in parallel tutorial sessions tailored to enhance your understanding and skills.
 
The school will be held simultaneously at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE) in Dwingeloo (the Netherlands), and the University of Pretoria (South Africa), with the latter serving as an auxiliary venue with limited participation. An online participation will also be possible, through following the lectures, and resolving the doubts with the experts via chat. However, we note that the hands-on sessions will be mainly in person.
