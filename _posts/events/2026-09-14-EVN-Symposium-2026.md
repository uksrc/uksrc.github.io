ukSRC is proud to support the 17th European VLBI Network Symposium, which is taking place at The University of Manchester this September. The EVN includes several SKA Pathfinders, and discussion will include VLBI techniques in the SKA era. 

The European VLBI Network Symposium is the main forum for discussion of the latest Very Long Baseline Interferometry scientific results and technical and technological developments within the EVN member countries. The purpose of this biennial meeting is to bring together the global VLBI community to exchange knowledge, share new research, discuss advancements in VLBI techniques, and foster a collaborative community in radio astronomy. 

List of Topics: 
- Stellar evolution 
- AGNs and SMBHs 
- Cosmology 
- Transients, pulsars and multi-messenger astrophysics 
- VLBI techniques and instrumentation 
- Next generation facilities 
- Astrometry, geodesy & space applications 
- EVN users meeting
