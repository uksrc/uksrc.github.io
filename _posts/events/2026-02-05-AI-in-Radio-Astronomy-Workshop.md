**Date:** Thursday 19 March & Friday 20 March 2026 <br>
**Location:** [Royal Observatory Edinburgh](https://www.roe.ac.uk/) <br>
**Website:** [Details of the workshop and how to register](https://www.roe.ac.uk/workshop/ai-radio-astronomy/)

This workshop will bring together the UK radio astronomy community to understand how artificial intelligence and data-driven methods will shape SKA-era science, and to ensure the UK's digital infrastructure, including the UK's SKA Regional Centre (ukSRC), is ready for the data-intensive challenges ahead. Hosted at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE), the workshop is jointly organised by the [UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC)](https://www.ukatc.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx), the [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA)](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/), and the ukSRC, and funded by [UKRI's Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI)](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/digital-research-infrastructure-programme/).

This workshop is funded by UKRI's Digital Research Infrastructure, and financial support is available to a limited number of participants, with priority going to early career researchers. Please register early (by 23rd February) and indicate in the registration form if you'd like to request support; we expect to confirm request by 27th February.

The 1.5-day workshop will be organised around three key areas, where we are soliciting your input: 
- Scientific drivers for AI in radio astronomy*: how do you and your team plan to use AI/ML for SKA-related science? 
- Technical enablers that make AI adoption possible: what are the computing facilities you will rely on? 
- Policy requirements for responsible and effective use of AI/ML: what is your approach to metascience principles such as FAIR data, sustainability, and transparency? 
 
Important Dates:  
- 23 February 2026: Abstract Deadline (and request for financial support) 
- 10 March 2026: Registration Deadline 
- 19-20 March 2026: Workshop at ROE 
 
*While the primary focus of our workshop, survey and study is radio astronomy in the UK, we invite participation from colleagues working in related fields.
