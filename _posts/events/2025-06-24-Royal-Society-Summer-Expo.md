The Royal Society's Summer Science Exhibition is a free annual showcase of some of the cutting-edge science and technology in the UK, suitable for all ages. Meet real scientists, discover the exciting research and technology they work on, and have fun with exciting interactive activities. Entry to the exhibition is free, you do not need a ticket - just come along on the day. 

Members of the UKSRC will be taking part in the **Unveiling the Universe: Exploring the Cosmos with the SKA Observatory** exhibit, alongside colleagues from the SKA Observatory (SKAO) and UKRI's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). The exhibition offers visitors a chance to explore the fascinating world of radio astronomy and learn about one of the most ambitious scientific projects underway today. Powerful new radio telescopes are under construction in South Africa and Australia, designed to help scientists investigate some of the biggest questions about the Universe. Come along to see how researchers and engineers from around the world—including many based in the UK—are overcoming major technical and data challenges to make this project a reality. You’ll be able to explore the telescopes, chat with researchers, and find out more about the UK's role in this global collaboration.
