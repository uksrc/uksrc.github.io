[STFC UK SKA Observatory Science Committee (UKSKAOSC)](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/stfc/how-we-are-governed/advisory-boards/ukskasc/) is organising a townhall on the 30th November 2023.

The meeting aims to bring the UK SKA community together to provide information on community engagement. The programme will include updates from the SKAO and the UK SKAO Regional Centre (SRC), and will include a focus on engagement with Early Career Researchers (ECRs; PhD/postdocs), who are particularly encouraged to attend. There will also be a panel discussion to allow opportunity to explore priorities from the UK science community on what they want in terms of community engagement from SKAO and related organisations. The confirmed speakers include key representatives from the SKAO, the UK SKAO Regional Centre, our UK SKAO Outreach Officer, and our UK SKAO Science Committee ECR representatives.  The meeting will be held at the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) in London - Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W1J 0BQ - and will be offered as a hybrid event. Please note that the event will start promptly at 10:30AM (arrival/registration to start from 10AM) and finish at 4:30PM. The agenda will be shared with all the registered attendees in due course.
